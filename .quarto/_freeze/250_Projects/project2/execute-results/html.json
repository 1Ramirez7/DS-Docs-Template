I analyze flight delay data to \nidentify the best months to fly and  uncover the main causes of delays, whether it's due to air carriers, weather, the national \naviation system, late-arriving aircraft, or security. This way, travelers can plan smarter and minimize disruptions.\n\n\n## Question|Task 1\n\n__Fix all of the varied missing data types in the data to be consistent (all missing values should be displayed as “NaN”).

From the boxplot, it appears that winter and summer have \nhigher delay ratios. This might be due to extreme weather conditions, such as snow in winter and \nstorms in summer.\n\n## Question|Task 4\n\n__According to the BTS website, the “Weather” category only accounts for severe weather delays. \nMild weather delays are not counted in the “Weather” category, but are actually included in both \nthe “NAS” and “Late-Arriving Aircraft” categories.

reasons for delays, categorized by carrier, security, and weather. From the graph, we can see that weather and carrier delays have higher probabilities, while security delays are almost negligible. For future analysis, we could examine which of these three delay types is most prevalent each month.\n\n",
